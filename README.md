# Predictive-Analysis-of-Dust-Particle
Built a dust prediction system using Arduino and PMS7003 to monitor PM levels. Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) and ML models (Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, K-means) to predict air quality (~85% accuracy) and trigger alerts for high-risk zones.
